Don't get me wrong: Dracula is an awesome theme, but some of the decisions that were made for implementing it on VS Code don't please me, to be honest. So I decided to fork it and try to bring the same experience that [OneDark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) brings with its uniform, subtle look and feel.

## Install

All instructions can be found at [INSTALL](https://github.com/mathcale/dracula-theme-refined/blob/HEAD/./INSTALL), but you could just open the **Extensions** tab on VS Code and search for "Dracula Refined" (without quotes).
